        <h4>MAKE A “MASTER LIST” OF RECIPES</h4>
        <p>When you're first starting out and are unsure of what to make, I suggest creating a Master List of recipes. I learned this informal process from my mom! Each week on Saturday morning, she would ask everyone in the house what their plans were for the week and take suggestions for dinner. From there, she'd go into her memory bank of favourite recipes, list out a couple we hadn't had in a while, then plug them into her meal plan, which was just a small piece of paper posted on the fridge each week.</p>
        <h4>Weekly Meal Prep Routine</h4>
        <p>There are 5 basic steps (plus one bonus step!) that I follow when I go to meal prep every week:</p>
        <h5>STEP 1</h5>
        <p>Choose 2-5 recipes from your Master List. I love to use  to organize my meal prep ideas () and then depending on my schedule that week, I'll go through and choose 2-5 recipes to make. These recipes usually double as lunches and dinners! Then, I'll either prep a breakfast or just have a few easy grab and go items on hand if I don't have time to.</p>
        <h5>STEP 2</h5>
        <p>Sit down and make your meal plan. Make the effort to sit down and plan out your meals at least once a week, even if you have to schedule that planning time into your calendar. From there, you'll add your recipes from your Master List into your meal plan. Learn about all my .</p>
        <h5>STEP 3</h5>
        <p>Go grocery shopping. Grocery shopping can seem like a huge chore but you just need to make your list efficiently and shop during downtimes (think after work or during the evenings on weekends). I've rounded up all my  if you need any additional help in this area.</p>
        <h5>STEP 4</h5>
        <p>Prep your ingredients or batch cook. Either prep your ingredients on the weekend (i.e. cook meat, cook and shred chicken, cook rice/quinoa, chop veggies, etc.) so that it's faster to cook your weeknight dinners, or you'll batch cook entire meals ahead of time so all you have to do is reheat the day-of. I'm a huge fan of ingredient prep myself and even built , a meal prep app, to help you through this process every week.</p>
        <h5>STEP 5</h5>
        <p>Store your food in the right containers. After you have cooked or prepped any ingredients for meals that you're going to cook later in the week, you'll want to store your food in the right containers. I have a list of my go-to meal prep containers below. HINT: you don't need a million different gadgets. Just some glass meal prep containers, freezer bags and round bowls will often do the trick!</p>
