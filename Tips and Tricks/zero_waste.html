    <h2 class="page-name">Zero Waste: Making the Most out of Your Meal</h2>
    <img class="sub-image" src="../Photos/zero_waste.jpg" />
    <div class="tip">
        <p>Have you ever found yourself looking at a pile of plastic bags and empty cardboard boxes after a run to the grocery store, wondering, “How can I go waste free in the kitchen?”</p>
        <p>Being “zero waste” doesn’t mean you will generate no waste at all. Our environmental footprint is a lot more complex than that.</p>
        <p>You might instead think of it as low waste living, because at its core, zero waste is nothing more magical than simply trying to live less wastefully, one small step (for man, one giant leap for mankind) at a time. </p>
        <h5>Buy In Bulk</h5>
        <p>Bulk food is anything not sold in plastic packaging (but don’t be tempted by the little plastic baggies hanging next to the bulk canisters; that would defeat the point!).

            Instead, bring your own jar or other reusable container to fill up on as much, or as little, of a product as you need. Make sure you know its “tare weight” (the weight of the container when empty) so the cashier can deduct that from the total.</p>
        <h5>Store Food In Zero Waste Containers</h5>
        <p>Glass jars are perhaps the most popular choice (not to mention a free one, since pretty much everyone can upcycle jars from foodstuffs). For example, maybe you have a nice sentimental bottle of wine from your wedding; give it a try as an olive oil container.</p>
        <h5>Prep To-Go Meals Like A Pro</h5>
        <p>Using reusable containers for your to-go meals instead of single-use takeaway products (the third-largest category of ocean plastic pollution) can save lots of space in the ocean.

            Like your zero waste home kitchen food storage solutions, an eco-friendly lunch box can consist of many materials, like stainless steel or bamboo. </p>
        <h5>Make The Switch To Reusable Utensils</h5>
        <p>Plastic straws, spoons, forks, and knives end up being ingested by wildlife, who either have their internal organs punctured by the sharp plastic or who have a feeling of “fake fullness” and die from starvation. 

            Having a reusable cutlery kit is a great way to reduce your plastic output and thus, your harm to the environment and wildlife.</p>
        <h5>Find A Second Use For Food Scraps</h5>
        <p>For instance, did you know that the scrap ends of onions, leeks, and spring onions can be put in water to be regrown into full sized stalks in just mere days?</p> 
        <p>Other vegetable scraps can easily be turned into a delicious vegetable stock to create an even more delicious vegetable soup. Just keep a container of scraps and peels in the freezer until you have enough to boil them into stock.</p>
